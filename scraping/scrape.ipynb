The Fortune 500 company manufactures products and provides engineering services for industrial, commercial, and consumer markets.\\nEmerson has approximately 86,700 employees and 170 manufacturing locations.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nEmerson was established in 1890 in St. Louis, Missouri, as Emerson Electric Manufacturing Co. by Civil War Union veteran John Wesley Emerson to manufacture electric motors using a patent owned by the Scottish-born brothers Charles and Alexander Meston. In 1892, it became the first to sell electric fans in the United States. It quickly expanded its product line to include electric sewing machines, electric dental drills, and power tools.\\n\\nDuring World War II, under the leadership of Stuart Symington, Emerson became the world\\'s largest manufacturer of airplane armament. Emerson ranked 52nd among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.In 1954, W.R. \"Buck\" Persons was named company president. Under his leadership, Emerson diversified it\\'s business by acquiring 36 companies. When he retired in 1973, the company had 82 plants, 31,000 employees, and $800 million in sales.\\nIn 1962, it acquired the United States Electrical Manufacturing Company as the U.S. Electrical Motors Division, including the brand U.S. Motors. In 1968, it acquired the InSinkErator company.Charles F. Knight served as CEO from 1973 to 2000, and was chairman from 1974 to 2004. His tenure marked the development of a rigorous planning process, new product and technology development, acquisitions and joint ventures, and international growth. David Farr succeeded him as chairman, and was also the CEO until 2021.\\nOn December 15, 1999, Emerson Electric agreed to acquire Jordan Industries Inc.\\'s telecommunications equipment business for $440 million.In 2010, the U.S. Motors brand was sold to Nidec Motor Corporation.On July 26, 2011, Emerson announced it would locate its Latin America headquarters in Sunrise, Florida.On December 1, 2016, Platinum Equity acquired the Emerson Network Power business for over $4 billion and rebranded it Vertiv. The acquisition included the brands ASCO, Chloride, Liebert, NetSure, and Trellis.In July 2018, Emerson completed the purchase of Textron Tools and Test Businesses for $810 million (Including Greenlee, Klauke, HD Electric, and Sherman + Reilly).On April 1, 2020, Emerson acquired American Governor Company to boost its presence in the hydropower control systems market.In October 2022, Emerson agreed to sell a 55 percent majority stake in its climate technologies business to private equity firm Blackstone Inc. in a $14 billion deal, including debt.Following a nearly year-long negotiation, in April 2023, Emerson agreed to acquire National Instruments in an all-cash deal worth $8.2 billion to further its automation business.\\n\\n\\n== Products ==\\nEmerson Electric produces the AN/APQ series of avionics\\n\\nAN/APG-69\\nAN/APQ-157\\nAN/APQ-159\\n\\n\\n== Corporate ==\\nThe company\\'s leaders since the mid-20th century have been, respectively, W. R. Persons (1954–1973; President), Charles Knight (1973–2000, CEO), and David Farr (2000–2021, CEO). The company\\'s chair of the board have been Charles Knight (1974–2004), and David Farr (2004–2021). Jim Turley is the current Chair of the Board.\\nEmerson is structured into two business units: automation; and commercial and residential.\\n\\n\\n== Environmental records ==\\nIn 2008 (using data from 2005), researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Emerson as the 97th largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, down from its previous rank of 56th. Major pollutants indicated by the study include nickel compounds, manganese, diisocyanate, and lead.\\n\\n\\n== Corporate relationships ==\\n\\n\\n=== Emerson\\'s brands acquisitions ===\\nOn December 22, 2014, Emerson announced the acquisition of Scotland-based Cascade Technologies Ltd., expanding their gas-analysis portfolio with laser-based measurement analyzers and systems for enhanced industrial emissions monitoring, production efficiencies, and regulatory compliance. Other main Emerson acquisitions and brands include:\\n\\n\\n=== NBC Heroes lawsuit ===\\nOn October 2, 2006, Emerson filed suit in federal court against NBC regarding a scene that appeared in the pilot episode of the network\\'s TV series Heroes. The scene depicted Claire Bennet reaching into an active garbage disposal, severely injuring her hand. Emerson\\'s suit claims the scene \"casts the disposer in an unsavory light, irreparably tarnishing the product\" by suggesting that serious injuries will result \"in the event consumers were to accidentally insert their hand into one.\"\\nEmerson asked for a ruling barring future broadcasts of the pilot and to block NBC from using any Emerson trademarks in the future.\\nOn February 23, 2007, the case was dropped. NBC Universal and Emerson Electric settled the lawsuit outside of court.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website\\nBusiness data for Emerson Electric Co.:',\n",

       "  'content': 'General Electric Company (GE) is an American multinational conglomerate founded in 1892 and incorporated in the state of New York and headquartered in Boston. The company has several divisions, including aerospace, power, renewable energy, digital industry, additive manufacturing, and venture capital and finance.In 2020, GE ranked among the Fortune 500 as the 33rd largest firm in the United States by gross revenue. In 2023, the company was ranked 64th in the Forbes Global 2000. In 2011, GE ranked among the Fortune 20 as the 14th most profitable company, but later very severely underperformed the market (by about 75%) as its profitability collapsed. Two employees of GE – Irving Langmuir (1932) and Ivar Giaever (1973) – have been awarded the Nobel Prize.On November 9, 2021, the company announced it would divide itself into three public companies. On July 18, 2022, GE unveiled the brand names of the companies it will create through its planned separation: GE Aerospace, GE HealthCare and GE Vernova. The new companies will be focused on aerospace, healthcare, and energy (renewable energy, power, and digital). The first spin-off of GE HealthCare was finalized on January 4, 2023; GE continues to hold 13.5% of shares and intends to sell the remaining over time. This will be followed by the spin-off of GE\\'s portfolio of energy businesses which plan to become GE Vernova in 2024. Following these transactions, GE will be an aviation-focused company; GE Aerospace will be the legal successor of the original GE.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Formation ===\\nDuring 1889, Thomas Edison (1847–1931) had business interests in many electricity-related companies, including Edison Lamp Company, a lamp manufacturer in East Newark, New Jersey; Edison Machine Works, a manufacturer of dynamos and large electric motors in Schenectady, New York; Bergmann & Company, a manufacturer of electric lighting fixtures, sockets, and other electric lighting devices; and Edison Electric Light Company, the patent-holding company and financial arm for Edison\\'s lighting experiments, backed by J. P. Morgan (1837–1913) and the Vanderbilt family.In 1889, Drexel, Morgan & Co., a company founded by J.P. Morgan and Anthony J. Drexel financed Edison\\'s research and helped merge several of Edison\\'s separate companies under one corporation forming Edison General Electric Company, which was incorporated in New York on April 24, 1889. The new company acquired Sprague Electric Railway & Motor Company in the same year. The consolidation did not involve all of the companies established by Edison; notably, the Edison Illuminating Company, which would later become Consolidated Edison, was not part of the merger.In 1880, Gerald Waldo Hart formed the American Electric Company of New Britain, Connecticut, which merged a few years later with Thomson-Houston Electric Company, led by Charles Coffin. In 1887, Hart left to become superintendent of the Edison Electric Company. General Electric was formed through the 1892 merger of Edison General Electric Company and Thomson-Houston Electric Company with the support of Drexel, Morgan & Co. The original plants of both companies continue to operate under the GE banner to this day.The General Electric business was incorporated in New York, with the Schenectady plant used as headquarters for many years thereafter. Around the same time, General Electric\\'s Canadian counterpart, Canadian General Electric, was formed.In 1893, General Electric bought the business of Rudolf Eickemeyer in Yonkers, New York, along with all of its patents and designs. Eickemeyer\\'s firm had developed transformers for use in the transmission of electrical power.\\n\\n\\n=== Public company ===\\nIn 1896, General Electric was one of the original 12 companies listed on the newly formed Dow Jones Industrial Average, where it remained a part of the index for 122 years, though not continuously.\\nIn 1911, General Electric absorbed the National Electric Lamp Association (NELA) into its lighting business. GE established its lighting division headquarters at Nela Park in East Cleveland, Ohio. The lighting division has since remained in the same location.\\n\\n\\n=== RCA and NBC ===\\nOwen D. Young, through GE, founded the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in 1919, after purchasing the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America. He aimed to expand international radio communications. GE used RCA as its retail arm for radio sales. In 1926, RCA co-founded the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), which built two radio broadcasting networks. In 1930, General Electric was charged with antitrust violations and was ordered to divest itself of RCA.\\n\\n\\n=== Television ===\\nIn 1927, Ernst Alexanderson of GE made the first demonstration of television broadcast reception at his General Electric Realty Plot home at 1132 Adams Road in Schenectady, New York. On January 13, 1928, he made what was said to be the first broadcast to the public in the United States on GE\\'s W2XAD: the pictures were picked up on 1.5 square inch (9.7 square centimeter) screens in the homes of four GE executives. The sound was broadcast on GE\\'s WGY (AM).Experimental television station W2XAD evolved into the station WRGB which, along with WGY and WGFM (now WRVE), was owned and operated by General Electric until 1983. In 1965, the company expanded into cable with the launch of a franchise, which was awarded to a non-exclusive franchise in Schenectady through subsidiary General Electric Cablevision Corporation. On February 15, 1965, General Electric expanded its holdings in order to acquire more television stations to meet the maximum limit of the FCC, and more cable holdings through subsidiaries General Electric Broadcasting Company and General Electric Cablevision Corporation.The company also owned television stations such as KOA-TV (now KCNC-TV) in Denver and WSIX-TV (later WNGE-TV, now WKRN) in Nashville, but like WRGB, General Electric sold off most of its broadcasting holdings, but held on to the Denver television station until in 1986, when General Electric bought out RCA and made it into an owned-and-operated station by NBC. It even stayed on until 1995 when it was transferred to a joint venture between CBS and Group W in a swap deal, alongside KUTV in Salt Lake City for longtime CBS O&O in Philadelphia, WCAU-TV.\\n\\n\\n==== Former General Electric-owned stations ====\\nStations are arranged in alphabetical order by state and city of license.\\n\\n\\n=== Radio stations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Power generation ===\\n\\nLed by Sanford Alexander Moss, GE moved into the new field of aircraft turbo superchargers. This technology also led to the development of industrial gas turbine engines used for power production. GE introduced the first set of superchargers during World War I, and continued to develop them during the interwar period. Superchargers became indispensable in the years immediately prior to World War II. GE supplied 300,000 turbo superchargers for use in fighter and bomber engines. This work led the U.S. Army Air Corps to select GE to develop the nation\\'s first jet engine during the war. This experience, in turn, made GE a natural selection to develop the Whittle W.1 jet engine that was demonstrated in the United States in 1941. GE was ranked ninth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. Although, their early work with Whittle\\'s designs was later handed to Allison Engine Company. GE Aviation then emerged as one of the world\\'s largest engine manufacturers, bypassing the British company, Rolls-Royce plc.\\nSome consumers boycotted GE light bulbs, refrigerators and other products during the 1980s and 1990s. The purpose of the boycott was to protest against GE\\'s role in nuclear weapons production.In 2002, GE acquired the wind power assets of Enron during its bankruptcy proceedings. Enron Wind was the only surviving U.S. manufacturer of large wind turbines at the time, and GE increased engineering and supplies for the Wind Division and doubled the annual sales to $1.2 billion in 2003. It acquired ScanWind in 2009.In 2018, GE Power garnered press attention when a model 7HA gas turbine in Texas was shut down for two months due to the break of a turbine blade. This model uses similar blade technology to GE\\'s newest and most efficient model, the 9HA. After the break, GE developed new protective coatings and heat treatment methods. Gas turbines represent a significant portion of GE Power\\'s revenue, and also represent a significant portion of the power generation fleet of several utility companies in the United States. Chubu Electric of Japan and Électricité de France also had units that were impacted. Initially, GE did not realize the turbine blade issue of the 9FB unit would impact the new HA units.\\n\\n\\n=== Computing ===\\nGE was one of the eight major computer companies of the 1960s along with IBM, Burroughs, NCR, Control Data Corporation, Honeywell, RCA, and UNIVAC. GE had a line of general purpose and special purpose computers, including the GE 200, GE 400, and GE 600 series general purpose computers, the GE 4010, GE 4020, and GE 4060 real-time process control computers, and the DATANET-30 and Datanet 355 message switching computers (DATANET-30 and 355 were also used as front end processors for GE mainframe computers). A Datanet 500 computer was designed, but never sold.In 1956 Homer Oldfield had been promoted to General Manager of GE\\'s Computer Department. He facilitated the invention and construction of the Bank of America ERMA system, the first computerized system designed to read magnetized numbers on checks. But he was fired from GE in 1958 by Ralph J. Cordiner for overstepping his bounds and successfully gaining the ERMA contract. Cordiner was strongly against GE entering the computer business because he did not see the potential in it.\\nIn 1962, GE started developing its GECOS (later renamed GCOS) operating system, originally for batch processing, but later extended to time-sharing and transaction processing. Versions of GCOS are still in use today. From 1964 to 1969, GE and Bell Laboratories (which soon dropped out) joined with MIT to develop the Multics operating system on the GE 645 mainframe computer. The project took longer than expected and was not a major commercial success, but it demonstrated concepts such as single-level storage, dynamic linking, hierarchical file system, and ring-oriented security. Active development of Multics continued until 1985.\\nGE got into computer manufacturing because in the 1950s they were the largest user of computers outside the United States federal government, aside from being the first business in the world to own a computer. Its major appliance manufacturing plant \"Appliance Park\" was the first non-governmental site to host one. However, in 1970, GE sold its computer division to Honeywell, exiting the computer manufacturing industry, though it retained its timesharing operations for some years afterwards. GE was a major provider of computer time-sharing services, through General Electric Information Services (GEIS, now GXS), offering online computing services that included GEnie.\\nIn 2000, when United Technologies Corp. planned to buy Honeywell, GE made a counter-offer that was approved by Honeywell. On July 3, 2001, the European Union issued a statement that \"prohibit the proposed acquisition by General Electric Co. of Honeywell Inc.\". The reasons given were it \"would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell\".On June 27, 2014, GE partnered with collaborative design company Quirky to announce its connected LED bulb called Link. The Link bulb is designed to communicate with smartphones and tablets using a mobile app called Wink.\\n\\n\\n=== Acquisitions and divestments ===\\n\\nIn December 1985, GE reacquired the RCA Corporation, primarily to gain ownership of the NBC television network (also parent of Telemundo Communications Group) for $6.28 billion; this merger surpassed the Capital Cities/ABC merger that happened earlier that year as the largest non-oil merger in world business history. The remainder of RCA was sold to various companies, including Bertelsmann which absorbed RCA Records and Thomson SA, which licensed the manufacture of RCA branded electronics, traced its roots to Thomson-Houston, one of the original components of GE. Also in 1986, Kidder, Peabody & Co., a U.S.-based securities firm, was sold to GE and following heavy losses was sold to PaineWebber in 1994.In 2002, Francisco Partners and Norwest Venture Partners acquired a division of GE called GE Information Systems (GEIS). The new company, named GXS, is based in Gaithersburg, Maryland. GXS is a provider of business-to-business e-commerce solutions. GE maintains a minority stake in GXS. Also in 2002, GE Wind Energy was formed when GE bought the wind turbine manufacturing assets of Enron Wind after the Enron scandals.In 2004, GE bought 80% of Vivendi Universal Entertainment, the parent of Universal Pictures from Vivendi. Vivendi bought 20% of NBC forming the company NBCUniversal. GE then owned 80% of NBCUniversal and Vivendi owned 20%. In 2004, GE completed the spin-off of most of its mortgage and life insurance assets into an independent company, Genworth Financial, based in Richmond, Virginia.Genpact formerly known as GE Capital International Services (GECIS) was established by GE in late 1997 as its captive India-based BPO. GE sold 60% stake in Genpact to General Atlantic and Oak Hill Capital Partners in 2005 and hived off Genpact into an independent business. GE is still a major client to Genpact today, for services in customer service, finance, information technology, and analytics.In May 2007, GE acquired Smiths Aerospace for $4.8 billion. Also in 2007, GE Oil & Gas acquired Vetco Gray for $1.9 billion, followed by the acquisition of Hydril Pressure & Control in 2008 for $1.1 billion.GE Plastics was sold in 2008 to SABIC (Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corporation). In May 2008, GE announced it was exploring options for divesting the bulk of its consumer and industrial business.On December 3, 2009, it was announced that NBCUniversal would become a joint venture between GE and cable television operator Comcast. Comcast would hold a controlling interest in the company, while GE would retain a 49% stake and would buy out shares owned by Vivendi.Vivendi would sell its 20% stake in NBCUniversal to GE for US$5.8 billion. Vivendi would sell 7.66% of NBCUniversal to GE for US$2 billion if the GE/Comcast deal was not completed by September 2010 and then sell the remaining 12.34% stake of NBCUniversal to GE for US$3.8 billion when the deal was completed or to the public via an IPO if the deal was not completed.On March 1, 2010, GE announced plans to sell its 20.85% stake in Turkey-based Garanti Bank. In August 2010, GE Healthcare signed a strategic partnership to bring cardiovascular Computed Tomography (CT) technology from start-up Arineta Ltd. of Israel to the hospital market. In October 2010, GE acquired gas engines manufacturer Dresser Industries in a $3 billion deal and also bought a $1.6 billion portfolio of retail credit cards from Citigroup Inc. On October 14, 2010, GE announced the acquisition of data migration & SCADA simulation specialists Opal Software. In December 2010, for the second time that year (after the Dresser acquisition), GE bought the oil sector company Wellstream, an oil pipe maker, for 800 million pounds ($1.3 billion).In March 2011, GE announced that it had completed the acquisition of privately held Lineage Power Holdings from The Gores Group. In April 2011, GE announced it had completed its purchase of John Wood plc\\'s Well Support Division for $2.8 billion.In 2011, GE Capital sold its $2 billion Mexican assets to Santander for $162 million and exited the business in Mexico. Santander additionally assumed the portfolio debts of GE Capital in the country. Following this, GE Capital focused in its core business and shed its non-core assets.In June 2012, CEO and President of GE Jeff Immelt said that the company would invest ₹3 billion  to accelerate its businesses in Karnataka. In October 2012, GE acquired $7 billion worth of bank deposits from MetLife Inc.On March 19, 2013, Comcast bought GE\\'s shares in NBCU for $16.7 billion, ending the company\\'s longtime stake in television and film media.In April 2013, GE acquired oilfield pump maker Lufkin Industries for $2.98 billion.In April 2014, it was announced that GE was in talks to acquire the global power division of French engineering group Alstom for a figure of around $13 billion. A rival joint bid was submitted in June 2014 by Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) with Siemens seeking to acquire Alstom\\'s gas turbine business for €3.9 billion, and MHI proposing a joint venture in steam turbines, plus a €3.1 billion cash investment. In June 2014 a formal offer from GE worth $17 billion was agreed by the Alstom board. Part of the transaction involved the French government taking a 20% stake in Alstom to help secure France\\'s energy and transport interests and French jobs. A rival offer from Siemens-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was rejected. The acquisition was expected to be completed in 2015. In October 2014, GE announced it was considering the sale of its Polish banking business Bank BPH.Later in 2014, General Electric announced plans to open its global operations center in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Global Operations Center opened in October 2016 as home to GE\\'s multifunctional shared services organization. It supports the company\\'s finance/accounting, human resources, information technology, supply chain, legal and commercial operations, and is one of GE\\'s four multifunctional shared services centers worldwide in Pudong, China; Budapest, Hungary; and Monterrey, Mexico.In April 2015, GE announced its intention to sell off its property portfolio, worth $26.5 billion, to Wells Fargo and The Blackstone Group. It was announced in April 2015 that GE would sell most of its finance unit and return around $90 billion to shareholders as the firm looked to trim down on its holdings and rid itself of its image of a \"hybrid\" company, working in both banking and manufacturing. In August 2015, GE Capital agreed to sell its Healthcare Financial Services business to Capital One for US$9 billion. The transaction involved US$8.5 billion of loans made to a wide array of sectors including senior housing, hospitals, medical offices, outpatient services, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Also in August 2015, GE Capital agreed to sell GE Capital Bank\\'s on-line deposit platform to Goldman Sachs. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but the sale included US$8 billion of on-line deposits and another US$8 billion of brokered certificates of deposit. The sale was part of GE\\'s strategic plan to exit the U.S. banking sector and to free itself from tightening banking regulations. GE also aimed to shed its status as a \"systematically important financial institution\".In September 2015, GE Capital agreed to sell its transportation-finance unit to Canada\\'s Bank of Montreal. The unit sold had US$8.7 billion (CA$11.5 billion) of assets, 600 employees and 15 offices in the U.S. and Canada. Exact terms of the sale were not disclosed, but the final price would be based on the value of the assets at closing, plus a premium according to the parties.

In October 2016, GE Renewable Energy agreed to pay €1.5 billion to Doughty Hanson & Co for LM Wind Power during 2017.At the end of October 2016, it was announced that GE was under negotiations for a deal valued at about $30 billion to combine GE Oil & Gas with Baker Hughes. The transaction would create a publicly traded entity controlled by GE. It was announced that GE Oil & Gas would sell off its water treatment business, GE Water & Process Technologies, as part of its divestment agreement with Baker Hughes. The deal was cleared by the EU in May 2017, and by the United States Department of Justice in June 2017. The merger agreement was approved by shareholders at the end of June 2017. On July 3, 2017, the transaction was completed and Baker Hughes became a GE company and was renamed Baker Hughes, a GE Company (BHGE). In November 2018, GE reduced its stake in Baker Hughes to 50.4%. On October 18, 2019, GE reduced its stake to 36.8% and the company was renamed back to Baker Hughes.In May 2017, GE had signed $15 billion of business deals with Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is one of GE\\'s largest customers. In September 2017, GE announced the sale of its Industrial Solutions Business to ABB.

GE is planning to divest its remaining interest and has warned that the divestment will result in an additional loss of $8.4 billion (assuming a BHGE share price of $23.57 per share). In response to the fraud allegations, GE noted the amount of the loss would be $7.4 billion if the divestment occurred on July 26, 2019.  Mr. Markopolos noted that BHGE is an asset available for sale and therefore mark-to-market accounting is required.Markopolos noted GE\\'s current ratio was only 0.67. He expressed concerns that GE may file for bankruptcy if there is a recession.\\n\\n\\n==== Other ====\\nIn 2018, the GE Pension Plan reported losses of US$3.3 billion on plan assets.In 2018, General Electric changed the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial liabilities of its pension plans.  The rate was increased from 3.64% to 4.34%.

Until 2017, the company had never cut dividends for 119 years before a 50% dividend reduction from 24 cents per share to 12 cents per share. In 2018, GE further reduced its quarterly dividend from 12 cents to 1 cent per share.\\n\\n\\n== Stock ==\\nAs a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, GE stock was one of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1907 to 2018, the longest continuous presence of any company on the index, and during this time the only company which was part of the original Dow Jones Industrial Index created in 1896. In August 2000, the company had a market capitalization of $601 billion, and was the most valuable company in the world. On June 26, 2018, the stock was removed from the index and replaced with Walgreens Boots Alliance.

In total, 29 companies and 45 executives would be convicted. Subsequent parliamentary inquiries revealed that \"white-collar crime\" was by far the most costly form of crime for the United States\\' finances.GE is a multinational conglomerate headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. However its main offices are located at 30 Rockefeller Plaza at Rockefeller Center in New York City, known now as the Comcast Building. It was formerly known as the GE Building for the prominent GE logo on the roof; NBC\\'s headquarters and main studios are also located in the building. Through its RCA subsidiary, it has been associated with the center since its construction in the 1930s. GE moved its corporate headquarters from the GE Building on Lexington Avenue to Fairfield, Connecticut in 1974. In 2016, GE announced a move to the South Boston Waterfront neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, partly as a result of an incentive package provide by state and city governments. The first group of workers arrived in the summer of 2016, and the full move will be completed by 2018. Due to poor financial performance and corporate downsizing, GE sold the land it planned to build its new headquarters building on, instead choosing to occupy neighboring leased buildings.GE\\'s tax return is the largest return filed in the United States; the 2005 return was approximately 24,000 pages when printed out, and 237 megabytes when submitted electronically.

CEO Jeff Immelt had a set of changes in the presentation of the brand commissioned in 2004, after he took the reins as chairman, to unify the diversified businesses of GE.Tom Geismar later stated that looking back at the logos of the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s, one can clearly judge that they are old-fashioned. Chermayeff & Geismar, along with colleagues Bill Brown and Ivan Chermaev, created the modern 1980 logo. They, in turn, argued that even now the old logos look out of date, earlier they were good. The changes included a new corporate color palette, small modifications to the GE logo, a new customized font (GE Inspira) and a new slogan, \"Imagination at work\", composed by David Lucas, to replace the slogan \"We Bring Good Things to Life\" used since 1979. The standard requires many headlines to be lowercased and adds visual \"white space\" to documents and advertising. The changes were designed by Wolff Olins and are used on GE\\'s marketing, literature, and website. In 2014, a second typeface family was introduced: GE Sans and Serif by Bold Monday created under art direction by Wolff Olins.As of 2016, GE had appeared on the Fortune 500 list for 22 years and held the 11th rank. GE was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average on June 28, 2018, after the value had dropped below 1% of the index\\'s weight.\\n\\n\\n== Businesses ==\\n\\nGE\\'s primary business divisions are:\\n\\nGE Additive\\nGE Aerospace\\nGE Capital\\nGE Digital\\nGE Healthcare\\nGE Power\\nGE Renewable Energy\\nGE ResearchThrough these businesses, GE participates in markets that include the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity (e.g. nuclear, gas and solar), industrial automation, medical imaging equipment, motors, aircraft jet engines, and aviation services.

It has a presence in over 100 countries.\\nGeneral Imaging manufacturers GE digital cameras.Even though the first wave of conglomerates (such as ITT Corporation, Ling-Temco-Vought, Tenneco, etc.) fell by the wayside by the mid-1980s, in the late 1990s, another wave (consisting of Westinghouse, Tyco, and others) tried and failed to emulate GE\\'s success.As of August 2015 GE is planning to set up a silicon carbide chip packaging R&D center in coalition with SUNY Polytechnic Institute in Utica, New York. The project will create 470 jobs with the potential to grow to 820 jobs within 10 years.On September 14, 2015, GE announced the creation of a new unit: GE Digital, which will bring together its software and IT capabilities. The new business unit will be headed by Bill Ruh, who joined GE in 2011 from Cisco Systems and has since worked on GE\\'s software efforts.Morgan Stanley sold a stake in GE HealthCare Technologies for $1.1 billion as part of a deal to swap General Electric Co. debt for GE HealthCare stock.\\n\\n\\n=== Former divisions ===\\nGE Industrial was a division providing appliances, lighting and industrial products; factory automation systems; plastics, silicones and quartz products; security and sensors technology, and equipment financing, management and operating services.

After some major realignments in late 2007, GE Industrial was organized in two main sub businesses:\\n\\nGE Consumer & Industrial\\nAppliances\\nElectrical Distribution\\nLighting\\nGE Enterprise Solutions\\nDigital Energy\\nGE Fanuc Intelligent Platforms\\nSecurity\\nSensing & Inspection TechnologiesThe former GE Plastics division was sold in August 2007 and is now SABIC Innovative Plastics.\\nOn May 4, 2008, it was announced that GE would auction off its appliances business for an expected sale of $5–8 billion. However, this plan fell through as a result of the recession.The former GE Appliances and Lighting segment was dissolved in 2014 when GE\\'s appliance division was attempted to be sold to Electrolux for $5.4 billion, but eventually sold it to Haier in June 2016 due to antitrust filing against Electrolux. GE Lighting (consumer lighting) and the newly created Current, powered by GE, which deals in commercial LED, solar, EV, and energy storage, became stand-alone businesses within the company, until the sale of the latter to American Industrial Partners in April 2019.The former GE Transportation division merged with Wabtec on February 25, 2019, leaving GE with a 24.9% holding in Wabtec.On July 1, 2020, GE Lighting was acquired by Savant Systems and remains headquartered at Nela Park in East Cleveland, Ohio.\\n\\n\\n== Environmental record ==\\n\\n\\n=== Carbon footprint ===\\nGeneral Electric Company reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 2,080 Kt (-310 /-13% y-o-y). There has been a consistent declining trend in reported emissions since 2016.\\n\\n\\n=== Pollution ===\\nSome of GE\\'s activities have given rise to large-scale air and water pollution. Based on data from 2000, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute listed the corporation as the fourth-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States (behind only E. I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., United States Steel Corp., and ConocoPhillips), with more than 4.4 million pounds per year (2,000 tons) of toxic chemicals released into the air. GE has also been implicated in the creation of toxic waste. According to United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) documents, only the United States Government, Honeywell, and Chevron Corporation are responsible for producing more Superfund toxic waste sites.In 1983, New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York to compel GE to pay for the clean-up of what was claimed to be more than 100,000 tons of chemicals dumped from their plant in Waterford, New York, which polluted nearby groundwater and the Hudson River. In 1999, the company agreed to pay a $250 million settlement in connection with claims it polluted the Housatonic River (at Pittsfield, Massachusetts) and other sites with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other hazardous substances.In 2003, acting on concerns that the plan proposed by GE did not \"provide for adequate protection of public health and the environment\", EPA issued an administrative order for the company to \"address cleanup at the GE site\" in Rome, Georgia, also contaminated with PCBs.The nuclear reactors involved in the 2011 crisis at Fukushima I in Japan were GE designs, and the architectural designs were done by Ebasco, formerly owned by GE. Concerns over the design and safety of these reactors were raised as early as 1972, but tsunami danger was not discussed at that time. As of 2014, the same model nuclear reactors designed by GE are operating in the US; however, as of May 31, 2019, the controversial Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station, in Plymouth, Massachusetts, has been shut down and is in the process of decommission.\\n\\n\\n==== Pollution of the Hudson River ====\\n\\nGE heavily contaminated the Hudson River with PCBs between 1947 and 1977. This pollution caused a range of harmful effects to wildlife and people who eat fish from the river. In 1983 EPA declared a 200-mile (320 km) stretch of the river, from Hudson Falls to New York City, to be a Superfund site requiring cleanup. This Superfund site is considered to be one of the largest in the nation. In addition to receiving extensive fines, GE is continuing its sediment removal operations, pursuant to the Superfund orders, in the 21st century.\\n\\n\\n==== Pollution of the Housatonic River ====\\nFrom c.\\u20091932 until 1977, GE polluted the Housatonic River with PCB discharges from its plant at Pittsfield, Massachusetts. EPA designated the Pittsfield plant and several miles of the Housatonic to be a Superfund site in 1997, and ordered GE to remediate the site. Aroclor 1254 and Aroclor 1260, products manufactured by Monsanto, were the principal contaminants that were discharged to the river. The highest concentrations of PCBs in the Housatonic River are found in Woods Pond in Lenox, Massachusetts, just south of Pittsfield, where they have been measured up to 110 mg/kg in the sediment. About 50% of all the PCBs currently in the river are estimated to be retained in the sediment behind Woods Pond dam. This is estimated to be about 11,000 pounds (5,000 kg) of PCBs. Former filled oxbows are also polluted. Waterfowl and fish who live in and around the river contain significant levels of PCBs and can present health risks if consumed. In 2020 GE completed remediation and restoration of its 10 manufacturing plant areas within the city of Pittsfield. As of 2023 plans for cleanup of the river south of the city are not finalized.\\n\\n\\n== Social responsibility ==\\n\\n\\n=== Environmental initiatives ===\\nThe environmental work and research of GE can be seen as early as 1968 with the experimental Delta electric car built by the GE Research and Development Center led by Bruce Laumeister. The electric car led to the production shortly after of the cutting-edge technology of the first commercially produced all-electric Elec-Trak garden tractor, which was manufactured from around 1969 until 1975.On June 6, 2011, GE announced that it has licensed solar thermal technology from California-based eSolar for use in power plants that use both solar and natural gas.On May 26, 2011, GE unveiled its EV Solar Carport, a carport that incorporates solar panels on its roof, with electric vehicle charging stations under its cover.In May 2005, GE announced the launch of a program called \"Ecomagination\", intended, in the words of CEO Jeff Immelt, \"to develop tomorrow\\'s solutions such as solar energy, hybrid locomotives, fuel cells, lower-emission aircraft engines, lighter and stronger durable materials, efficient lighting, and water purification technology\". The announcement prompted an op-ed piece in The New York Times to observe that, \"while General Electric\\'s increased emphasis on clean technology will probably result in improved products and benefit its bottom line, Mr. Immelt\\'s credibility as a spokesman on national environmental policy is fatally flawed because of his company\\'s intransigence in cleaning up its own toxic legacy.\"GE has said that it will invest $1.4 billion in clean technology research and development in 2008 as part of its Ecomagination initiative. As of October 2008, the scheme had resulted in 70 green products being brought to market, ranging from halogen lamps to biogas engines. In 2007, GE raised the annual revenue target for its Ecomagination initiative from $20 billion in 2010 to $25 billion following positive market response to its new product lines. In 2010, GE continued to raise its investment by adding $10 billion into Ecomagination over the next five years.GE Energy\\'s renewable energy business has expanded greatly, to keep up with growing U.S. and global demand for clean energy. Since entering the renewable energy industry in 2002, GE has invested more than $850 million in renewable energy commercialization. In August 2008, it acquired Kelman Ltd, a Northern Ireland-based company specializing in advanced monitoring and diagnostics technologies for transformers used in renewable energy generation and announced an expansion of its business in Northern Ireland in May 2010. In 2009, GE\\'s renewable energy initiatives, which include solar power, wind power and GE Jenbacher gas engines using renewable and non-renewable methane-based gases, employ more than 4,900 people globally and have created more than 10,000 supporting jobs.GE Energy and Orion New Zealand (Orion) have announced the implementation of the first phase of a GE network management system to help improve power reliability for customers. GE\\'s ENMAC Distribution Management System is the foundation of Orion\\'s initiative. The system of smart grid technologies will significantly improve the network company\\'s ability to manage big network emergencies and help it to restore power faster when outages occur.\\nIn June 2018, GE Volunteers, an internal group of GE employees, along with Malaysian Nature Society, transplanted more than 270 plants from the Taman Tugu forest reserve so that they may be replanted in a forest trail which is under construction.\\n\\n\\n=== Educational initiatives ===\\nGE Healthcare is collaborating with the Wayne State University School of Medicine and the Medical University of South Carolina to offer an integrated radiology curriculum during their respective MD Programs led by investigators of the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity study. GE has donated over one million dollars of Logiq E Ultrasound equipment to these two institutions.\\n\\n\\n=== Marketing initiatives ===\\n\\nBetween September 2011 and April 2013, GE ran a content marketing campaign dedicated to telling the stories of \"innovators—people who are reshaping the world through act or invention\". The initiative included 30 3-minute films from leading documentary film directors (Albert Maysles, Jessica Yu, Leslie Iwerks, Steve James, Alex Gibney, Lixin Fan, Gary Hustwit and others), and a user-generated competition that received over 600 submissions, out of which 20 finalists were chosen.Short Films, Big Ideas was launched at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival in partnership with cinelan. Stories included breakthroughs in Slingshot (water vapor distillation system), cancer research, energy production, pain management and food access. Each of the 30 films received world premiere screenings at a major international film festival, including the Sundance Film Festival and the Tribeca Film Festival. The winning amateur director film, The Cyborg Foundation, was awarded a US$100,000 prize at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. According to GE, the campaign garnered more than 1.5 billion total media impressions, 14 million online views, and was seen in 156 countries.In January 2017, GE signed an estimated $7 million deal with the Boston Celtics to have its corporate logo put on the NBA team\\'s jersey.\\n\\n\\n=== Charity ===\\nOn March 3, 2022, GE published an international memo pledging to donate $4.5 million to Ukraine amid Russian invasion. According to the memo, $4 million will be used for medical equipment, $400,000 for emergency cash for refugees and $100,000 will go to Airlink, a NGO that helps communities in crisis.\\n\\n\\n== Political affiliation ==\\nIn the 1950s, GE sponsored Ronald Reagan\\'s TV career and launched him on the lecture circuit. GE has also designed social programs, supported civil rights organizations, and funded minority education programs.\\n\\n\\n== Notable appearances in media ==\\nIn the early 1950s, Kurt Vonnegut was a writer for GE. A number of his novels and stories (notably Cat\\'s Cradle and Player Piano) refer to the fictional city of Ilium, which appears to be loosely based on Schenectady, New York. The Ilium Works is the setting for the short story \"Deer in the Works\".\\nIn 1981, GE won a Clio award for its :30 Soft White Light Bulbs commercial, We Bring Good Things to Life. The slogan \"We Bring Good Things to Life\" was created by Phil Dusenberry at the ad agency BBDO.GE was the primary focus of a 1991 short subject Academy Award-winning documentary, Deadly Deception: General Electric, Nuclear Weapons, and Our Environment, that juxtaposed GE\\'s \"We Bring Good Things To Life\" commercials with the true stories of workers and neighbors whose lives have been affected by the company\\'s activities involving nuclear weapons.GE was frequently mentioned and parodied in the NBC comedy sitcom 30 Rock from 2006 to 2013. Former General Electric CEO Jack Welch even cameoed as himself appearing in the season four episode \"Future Husband\". The episode is a satirical reference to the real-world acquisition of NBC Universal from General Electric by Comcast in November 2009.In 2013, GE received a National Jefferson Award for Outstanding Service by a Major Corporation.\\n\\n\\n== Branding ==\\n\\nThe General Electric logo has a blue circle with a white outline. It has four white lines which \"suggest the blades of a midcentury tabletop fan\". In the center of the circle is the letters \"GE.\" Its design has changed little through the company\\'s history. The logo is officially known as the Monogram, but is also known by some as \"the meatball\".\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nGE Technology Infrastructure\\nKnolls Atomic Power Laboratory\\nList of assets owned by General Electric\\nPhoebus cartel\\nTop 100 US Federal Contractors\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nCarlson, W.

       "  'content': 'Republic Services, Inc. is a North American waste disposal company whose services include non-hazardous solid waste collection, waste transfer, waste disposal, recycling, and energy services. It is the second largest provider of waste disposal in the United States (as measured by revenue) after Waste Management.\\n\\n\\n== Company history ==\\nRepublic Industries was created as a waste disposal firm in 1981. Wayne Huizenga became chairman of the board in 1995, when Republic Industries began acquiring auto dealerships and car rental agencies. In 1998, Republic Industries spun off Republic Services as an IPO, and then changed its name to AutoNation.In June 2008, Republic became the second largest waste management company in the United States following the acquisition of its larger competitor, Allied Waste Industries, for $6.1 billion in Republic stock. The merged company retained the Republic Services name.The Wall Street Journal reported in June 2010 that Republic Services’ $4 billion acquisition of Allied in December 2008  \"has been successful from the start\", delivering at the high end of the annual savings projected when they did the deal ($191 million), a 27 percent increase in share price.After 12 years as CEO of Republic Services, James O’Connor retired on January 1, 2011, and was replaced by the president and COO of Republic Services, Don Slager. In May 2019, Jon Vander Ark took over as president. In 2021, Slager retired and Vander Ark was named CEO.James P. Snee and Katharine Weymouth were appointed to the Republic Services Board of Directors in 2018, resulting in a total of 12 board members, 11 of them independent.Based on an annual report published in 2018, with a revenue of $10 billion, the firm retained the number two position in the industry.\\n\\n\\n== Operations ==\\nRepublic Services’ operations primarily consist of providing collection, transfer, and disposal of non-hazardous solid waste, recovering and recycling of certain materials, and energy services.As of December 31, 2017, it operated in 40 states and Puerto Rico through 343 collection operations, 204 transfer stations, 195 active landfills, 90 recycling centers, 7 treatment, recovery, and disposal facilities, and 11 salt water disposal wells. Republic also operated 68 landfill gas and renewable energy projects and had post-closure responsibility for 124 closed landfills.In January 2016, Republic realigned its field support functions by combining its three regions into two field groups, consolidating its areas, and streamlining select operational support roles at its Phoenix headquarters.\\n\\n\\n=== Landfills ===\\nRepublic Services owns or operates 206 active landfills. They also have responsibility for 128 closed landfills, for which they have associated closure and post-closure obligations.:\\u200a2\\u200a Republic Services owns and operates the largest landfill in the United States at 2,200 acres (890 ha) located in Apex, Nevada.In 2008, at the time that Republic Services bought Allied Waste, it acquired two closed St. Louis, Missouri landfills, West Lake and Bridgeton. An underground event (more accurately referred to as a “smoldering event”)   was detected in the closed Bridgeton Landfill. Due to the odors emitted from the landfill and its proximity to the adjacent West Lake—an EPA-managed Super Fund site that contains low-level radioactive waste dumped there illegally over forty years ago—environmental groups got involved.Republic operates the Bridgeton Landfill near St. Louis, Missouri. The landfill is the site of an underground event of concern to residents and the EPA.\\n\\n\\n=== Recycling centers ===\\nRepublic owns or operates 71 recycling centers that process over 5 million tons of recyclables annually. These centers generate revenue through the processing and sale of old corrugated containers (OCC), old newsprint (ONP), aluminum, glass and other materials, which accounted for approximately 3% of total revenue during 2022. Approximately 81% of the total recycling processing center volume is fiber-based and includes OCC, ONP and other mixed paper. During 2022, recycling processing centers processed and sold 2.0 million tons, excluding glass and organics. An additional 2.0 million tons were collected and delivered to third parties.:\\u200a14\\u200aAt the end of 2015, Republic Services opened a $35 million, 110,000 square-foot North Las Vegas Recycling Center, designed by local architect Edward Vance of EV&A Architects. The plant\\'s solar panels generate enough energy to run the plant for two to three months. The plant can process two million pounds of recycled paper each day, or 70 tons per hour. Eventually, the plant will be able to recycle three million pounds of paper per day. Optical sorters use 2D and 3D technologies to speed sorting.\\n\\n\\n== Regulation ==\\nRepublic Services, along with all other waste and recycling companies, are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local requirements that regulate, among other things, the environment, public health, safety, zoning, and land use. Operating and other permits, licenses, and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations, certain solid waste collection vehicles, fuel storage tanks, and other facilities that they own or operate. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations vary, but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges, air emissions, the handling, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances. These laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and various other federal, state, and local authorities administer these regulations.:\\u200a16–17\\u200a\\n\\n\\n== Customer service centers ==\\nIn January 2016, the company said it will invest $20 million in 2016 to design and implement its Customer Resource Centers in addition to other customer focused initiatives. The company expects the changes to result in a yearly savings of about $10 million.The plan calls for the consolidation of 108 regional customer centers into three main customer resource centers in Fishers, Indiana, Charlotte, North Carolina, and Chandler, Arizona.In February 2016 it was announced by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory and N.C. Commerce Secretary John E. Skvareta, III, that Republic Services was planning to open a full-service Customer Resource Center in Charlotte. It is expected that the facility will create over 350 new jobs, while Republic\\'s investment in the center is projected to be over $6.8 million over the next three years.In April 2017, Republic Services opened a customer service center in Fishers, Indiana, employing over 250 workers, with plans to hire an additional 120 during the year. The company invested $13.6 million to renovate and equip office space along the I-69 corporate corridor in Fishers. The customer service office is expected to create up to 469 new jobs by 2025.\\n\\n\\n== Corporate responsibility, sustainability, and innovation ==\\nRepublic Services scored in the 90th percentile of the Commercial Services and Supplies sector of the 2016 Dow Jones Sustainability—North America Index™ (DJSI) and was also named to the 2016 DJSI World and North America indices. Republic is the only recycling and solid waste collection provider in the Commercial Services and Supplies sector that is included in the 2016 DJSI World Index. The rankings highlight Republic\\'s leadership in corporate governance, environmental, social, and financial aspects of sustainability.The Blue Planet sustainability initiative is Republic Services’ approach to corporate social responsibility through their efforts to reduce emissions from operations; improve materials management; improve safety standards; increase community engagement; and a focus on employee growth opportunities. At the end of August 2017, the company released its most recent Sustainability Report describing how well it was able to advance its sustainability initiatives.In September 2019, the company became the first US solid waste and recycling provider whose emissions reduction targets were approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative. These goals meet the targets that the Paris Agreement requires.In 2019 Republic Services was acknowledged by Barron\\'s as one of the United States\\' 100 Most Sustainable Companies for the second consecutive year.The company was listed on Forbes as one of the country\\'s best employers for women, the only Arizona-based company to do so.\\n\\n\\n=== Recycling ===\\nIn partnership with the Alabama Coastal Foundation (ACF) Republic Services launched an oyster shell collection program in May 2017 with several coastal restaurants. Funded by a two-year grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the goal of the collection program is to create sustainable oyster habitats and to teach the public about the importance of oyster shell recycling. In just over nine months the ACF collected 10.1 acres of shells, which were recycled back into the Gulf of Mexico, creating new habitats for baby oysters, shrimp, and crab.At the end of August 2017, Republic Services signed a deal to purchase ReCommunity Holdings, the largest independent recycling-processing company in the United States. ReCommunity operates 26 recycling centers in 14 states, manufacturing reusable items from waste. ReCommunity\\'s plants recover about 1.6 million tons of recyclable commodities annually, which will help Republic Services achieve their \"Blue Planet\" sustainable initiative of adding at least 150,000 tons of recycling capacity per year by 2018.The company implements a Recycling Simplified Education Program which includes K-12 lesson plans, a website that explains what can and cannot be recycled, and other information to help educate the public about recycling. The program won the 2019 Best Recycling Public Education Program Award.\\n\\n\\n=== Solar energy ===\\nIn 2017 the company invested $29 million in solar projects at some of its landfills and other locations. Republic Services has either built, invested in, or operates over 236,000 solar panels at 19 generating facilities in the US, with a total capacity of 80 megawatts, enough electricity to power 208,000 homes.In September 2017, Republic Services and Soltage activated a 13.5 megawatt solar energy project in Massachusetts. When finished, the project, constructed on three former landfill sites, will include approximately 41,000 solar panels to power 1,900 local households and reduce carbon emissions by more than 14,000 tons.\\n\\n\\n=== Composting ===\\nIn April 2016 the city of Boise, Idaho considered the implementation of a composting program, utilizing Republic Services, the company that was already hauling garbage in the city. The program went into effect in June 2017. After a little more than one month, the company picked up 1,716 tons of compost from Boise\\'s single-family homes.\\n\\n\\n=== Landfill gas to energy (LFGTE) ===\\nThe Pinehill Landfill in Longview, Texas, will generate 404 million cubic feet of renewable natural gas per year, taking the place of over 19 million gallons of gas annually, with a concomitant reduction in carbon emissions.In July 2016 Republic Services and Mas Energy launched a new renewable energy project to serve the metropolitan Atlanta area. The project includes three landfill gas-to-energy facilities in Buford, Griffin, and Winder. The facilities will produce 24.1 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 15,665 households.  The three facilities together will be the largest landfill gas-to-energy project in Georgia. \\nRepublic Services converts landfill gas, the natural byproduct of decomposing waste, to energy. The use of landfill gas is beneficial to the U.S. economy by reducing air pollution through the capture and use of methane. As of July 2016, Republic Services operated 69 landfill gas and renewable energy projects.In April 2015 Republic Services opened a landfill gas-to-energy project near Los Angeles at the Sunshine Canyon Landfill. The 20-megawatt renewable energy project can supply enough electricity to power almost 25,000 homes in the area.In 2008, Republic Services agreed to pay a $1 million fine and up to $36 million in remediation costs for alleged violations of the Clean Water Act at a closed landfill in Clark County, Nevada.In 2007, Republic Services was fined $725,000 by the State of California related to hazardous waste leaking from a closed landfill into San Francisco Bay.\\n\\n\\n== Lobbying ==\\nIn 2014, Republic Services gave $50,000 to Missouri Republicans to their House and Senate campaign committees and $20,000 to House and Senate committees for Missouri Democrats.\\n\\n\\n== Criticism and controversy ==\\n\\n\\n=== West Lake Landfill (Missouri) ===\\nRepublic Services is identified by the EPA as one of four potentially responsible parties for the EPA Superfund cleanup site West Lake Landfill in Bridgeton, Missouri. Its contents have been shown to include radioactive waste and it was featured in the 2017 HBO documentary Atomic Homefront.In 2013 the company said it would build a barrier to separate the section with a subsurface smoldering fire from the section with radioactive waste, but because the EPA was uncertain where the radioactive contamination was located, progress on the barrier was delayed for more than a year. In response to criticism that the EPA was not moving quickly enough to clean up West Lake Landfill, Republic Services spent between $10,000 and $100,000 on advertising in 2015, according to spokesman Russ Knocke. This included employing representatives to criticize community activists on social media.In March 2016 the EPA released studies that showed the extent of the radioactive waste on the site and allowed the company to build a barrier without disturbing the radioactive areas. During the construction of the barrier, Republic also must submit plans for a cooling system, which must be completed within four months of commencement of construction. The company will also enlarge onto the north quarry of Bridgeton Landfill a plastic liner that it already installed over the south quarry. Environmental Protection Agency Region 7 Administrator Mark Hague said this should help control the reaction by blocking oxygen “as well as mitigate some of the odors coming off of this site.” Republic will also install more temperature monitors plus two sulfur dioxide monitors to track unhealthy emissions. They will also be required to develop a system that can quickly extinguish any new hot spots that the underground event might create.\\n\\n\\n=== Hurtado et al v. Rainbow Environmental Services and Republic Services (California) ===\\nIn September 2017, former and current employees of Republic Services at the former Rainbow Environmental Services waste transfer station in Huntington Beach, California, filed a legal complaint pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, regarding the illegal sale of the former employee-owned company to Republic Services in 2014. The lawsuit alleged a series of \"bad-faith dealings made by the executive leadership of Rainbow, through which they funded the creation of new companies and otherwise redirected ESOP assets. Apart from allegedly violating the plan document, these investments caused losses to the Rainbow ESOP while benefiting the executives, according to plaintiffs.\" In the decision, there is a section that describes the alleged role played by a fake attorney who, according to the plaintiffs, was a Republic Services corporate manager who attempted to intimidate or misdirect potential plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs, representing 400-plus former and current employees, agreed in May 2021 to a $7.9 million settlement.\\n\\n\\n=== National Treasure Historic Wintersburg (California) ===\\nIn October 2014, Republic Services purchased Rainbow Environmental Services in Huntington Beach, California. The purchase included a National Treasure Historic Place representing 100-plus years of Japanese American history known as Historic Wintersburg. The property previously was listed as one of \"America\\'s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places\" in 2014 and designated a \"National Treasure\" in 2015.The Ocean View School District, a public elementary school district in Huntington Beach, California, blocked changes by Republic Services to the Historic Wintersburg property in a 2013 legal complaint regarding the waste transfer station\\'s impacts on the Oak View Preschool and Oak View Elementary School.  A legal settlement in 2016 included a provision that Republic Services “will not use the adjacent ‘Historic Wintersburg’ property to expand any of their operations.\" Republic Services made public statements they would not demolish the property\\'s six historic structures and would participate in discussions regarding the purchase and preservation of Historic Wintersburg as a heritage park.In February 2018, Republic unexpectedly disclosed its intent to sell Historic Wintersburg for development as a self-storage facility. Historical and civil rights organizations protested, including the City of Huntington Beach Historic Resources Board. As of 2022, Republic Services continues to own the endangered historic property. On February 25, 2022, two of the oldest structures on the property, the 1910 Wintersburg Japanese Mission and 1910 manse (parsonage), were lost to fire and demolition.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nRepublic Services\\nBusiness data for Republic Services: \\nSustainability',\n",

Schulze financed the opening of his first store with his personal savings and a second mortgage he took out on his family\\'s home. In 1967, Sound of Music acquired Kencraft Hi-Fi Company and Bergo Company. Sound of Music earned $1 million in revenue and made about $58,000 in profits in its first year. In 1969, Sound of Music had three stores and Schulze bought out his business partner.\\nSound of Music operated nine stores throughout Minnesota by 1978. In 1981, the Roseville location, at the time the largest and most profitable Sound of Music store, was hit by a tornado. The store\\'s roof was sheared off and showroom destroyed, but the storeroom was left intact. In response, Schulze decided to have a \"Tornado Sale\" of damaged and excess stock in the damaged store\\'s parking lot. He poured the remainder of his marketing budget into advertising the sale, promising \"best buys\" on everything. Sound of Music made more money during the four-day sale than it did in a typical month.\\nIn 1983, with seven stores and $10 million in annual sales, Sound of Music was renamed Best Buy Company, Inc. The company also expanded its product offerings to include home appliances and VCRs, in an attempt to expand beyond its then-core customer base of 15- to 18-year-old males. Later that year, Best Buy opened its first superstore in Burnsville, Minnesota. The Burnsville location featured a high-volume, low-price business model, which was borrowed partially from Schulze\\'s successful Tornado Sale in 1981. In its first year, the Burnsville store out-performed all other Best Buy stores combined.Best Buy was taken public in 1985, and two years later it debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1988, Best Buy was in a price and location war with Detroit-based appliance chain Highland Superstores, and Schulze attempted to sell the company to Circuit City for US$30 million. Circuit City rejected the offer, claiming they could open a store in Minneapolis and \"blow them away.\"In 1988, the company introduced a new store concept dubbed \"Concept II\". Concept II replaced dimly lit industrial-style stores with brighter and more fashionably fixtured stores. Stores also began placing all stock on the sales floor rather than in a stock room, had fewer salespersons and provided more self-help product information for its customers. Best Buy also did away with commissioned salespeople. The commission-free sales environment \"created a more relaxed shopping environment free of the high-pressure sales tactics used in other stores,\" but was unpopular with salespersons and suppliers. Upset that their products would no longer be pushed by salespeople, some suppliers such as Maytag, Whirlpool, and Sony stopped selling in Best Buy stores altogether. The suppliers returned after Best Buy\\'s sales and revenue grew following the roll-out of Concept II.In 1992, the company achieved $1 billion in annual revenues. Its Midwest rival, Highland would file for bankruptcy in the same year and close all locations by 1993.\\nIn 1994, Best Buy debuted \"Concept III\" stores in several new markets including Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Concept III stores were larger than previous stores and included expanded product offerings, \"Answer Center\" touchscreen kiosks that displayed product information for both customers and employees, and demonstration areas for products such as surround sound stereo systems and video games.Best Buy launched its \"Concept IV\" stores with its expansion into New England in 1998. Concept IV stores included an open layout with products organized by category, cash registers located throughout the store, and slightly smaller stores than Concept III stores. The stores also had large areas for demonstrating home theater systems and computer software.In 1999, Best Buy was added to Standard & Poor\\'s S&P 500.\\n\\n\\n=== 2000s ===\\n\\nIn 2000, Best Buy formed Redline Entertainment, an independent music label and action-sports video distributor. The company acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi, Inc., an audio-video retailer located in California, Washington, and Oregon, in December 2000.In January 2001, Best Buy acquired Musicland Stores Corporation, a Minnetonka, Minnesota-based retailer that sold home-entertainment products under the Sam Goody, Suncoast Motion Picture Company, Media Play, and OnCue brands. Best Buy purchased the company for $425 million in cash and the assumption of $271 million of Musicland debt. Later that year, Best Buy acquired the British Columbia, Canada-based electronics-chain Future Shop Ltd., marking its entrance to the international marketplace. Under the deal, Future Shop was purchased for about US$377 million and continued to operate as subsidiary independent from Best Buy Canada.Brad Anderson succeeded Richard Schulze as Best Buy CEO in July 2002. Anderson had begun working at Best Buy in 1973 while attending seminary school. He was promoted to vice president in 1981 and executive vice president in 1986. Anderson had most recently served as president and COO of Best Buy, a position he had held since 1991. In September of that year, Best Buy opened the first Canadian Best Buy-branded store in Mississauga, Ontario. In October, Best Buy acquired Minneapolis-based Geek Squad, then a 24-hour residential computer repair business with offices in Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.Best Buy stores in the U.S. surpassed the 600-store mark and the company opened its first global-sourcing office in Shanghai in 2003. In June, Best Buy divested itself of Musicland in a deal with Sun Capital Partners under which Sun Capital received all of Musicland\\'s stock and debt. Best Buy launched its \"Reward Zone\" loyalty program in July following an 8-month test of the program in San Diego, California. Also in 2003, Best Buy\\'s corporate offices were consolidated into a single campus in Richfield, Minnesota.\\nIn January 2004, Best Buy hired Virtucom Group to revamp Best Buy\\'s website and handle all of the company\\'s online content. In May, the company launched its \"customer centricity\" program, which segmented its stores according to customer profiles. The program also called for employees to focus on specific customer groups rather than product categories. In October, Best Buy completed rolling out Geek Squad \"precincts\" in every American Best Buy store.In April 2005, Best Buy began eliminating mail-in rebates in response to negative customer reaction against them, and instead started giving out instant rebates via notebook computers.In May 2006, Best Buy acquired a majority interest in Chinese appliance retailer Jiangsu Five Star Appliance for $180 million. At the time of the deal, Jiangsu was the fourth-largest appliance chain in China with 193 stores across eight Chinese provinces. In June, the company opened Geek Squad precincts at Office Depot in Orlando, Florida. The market test was later expanded to Denver.In January 2007, the first Best Buy-branded store in China officially opened in Shanghai. In March 2007, Best Buy acquired Speakeasy, a Seattle-based broadband VOIP, data, and IT services provider. The acquisition was worth $80 million, and under terms of the deal, Speakeasy began operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy. The company\\'s products also became part of Best Buy\\'s For Business program. Best Buy also expanded its Geek Squad market tests in March, opening Geek Squad precincts in FedEx Kinkos stores located in Indianapolis and Charlotte, North Carolina. In October 2007, Best Buy became the first consumer-electronics retailer to exit the analog television market, carrying only digital products that became mandatory in June 2009 by the FCC.In February 2008, Best Buy opened its first store in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Best Buy\\'s Geek Squad market tests in Office Depot and FedEx Kinkos stores ended by March. Also in March, the company began promoting the Blu-ray optical-disc format over the HD DVD format, a move which ultimately contributed to Toshiba\\'s decision to drop HD DVD. In May, the company agreed to buy 50% of the retail division of The Carphone Warehouse, a London, England-based mobile phone retailer. The deal was worth $2.1 billion.In July 2008, Best Buy announced that it would start selling musical instruments and related gear in over 80 of its retail stores, making the company the second-largest musical-instrument distributor in the US. Best Buy became the first third-party retail seller of Apple\\'s iPhone in September. Later that month, the company agreed to acquire Napster for $121 million. In December, Best Buy opened its first store in Mexico.In February 2009, Best Buy leveraged its partnership with The Carphone Warehouse to launch Best Buy Mobile, a Best Buy-branded mobile retailer. Best Buy Mobile standalone stores were opened in shopping malls and urban downtowns. These Best Buy Mobile outlets were also added in all Best Buy-branded stores.In June 2009, Brian J. Dunn became Best Buy CEO. Dunn replaced Brad Anderson, who was retiring. Dunn had joined Best Buy in 1985 as a sales associate. In 2000, Dunn became senior vice president of East Coast operations and president of North American retail operations in 2004. His most recent position was as president of Best Buy since 2006.In November 2009, Best Buy partnered with Roxio\\'s CinemaNow to launch an on-demand streaming service which allowed streaming from any Internet device sold by Best Buy.In December 2009, Best Buy opened its first Turkish store in İzmir.\\n\\n\\n=== 2010s ===\\nIn April 2010, Best Buy opened its first United Kingdom-based Best Buy-branded store in Thurrock. The company eventually opened 11 Best Buy stores in the United Kingdom, all of which were closed in early 2012. In November 2011, Best Buy purchased The Carphone Warehouse\\'s share of Best Buy Mobile for $1.3 billion. Best Buy and The Carphone Warehouse maintained their Best Buy Europe joint venture, which at the time operated 2,500 mobile phone stores throughout Europe.The company closed all of its Best Buy-branded stores in China by February 2011, when it merged Best Buy China\\'s operations with Jiangsu Five Star, which had become a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy in 2009. In December 2011, Best Buy purchased mindSHIFT Technologies, a company that provided IT support for small and medium-sized businesses, for $167 million.In 2012, in response to overall revenue decline, Best Buy announced plans to undergo a \"transformation strategy\". Stores began to adopt a redesigned \"Connected Store\" format, providing the Geek Squad with a centralized service desk and implementing a \"store-within-a-store\" concept for Pacific Kitchen & Bath and Magnolia Design Center.In April 2012, Brian Dunn resigned as Best Buy\\'s CEO during an internal company investigation into allegations of personal misconduct stemming from an inappropriate relationship with a female Best Buy employee. Best Buy named Director George L. Mikan III interim CEO following Dunn\\'s resignation. The internal investigation was released in May 2012 and alleged that Best Buy founder and chairman Richard Schulze knew of Dunn\\'s inappropriate relationship and failed to notify the Best Buy board. Schulze subsequently resigned his chairmanship of the company. Best Buy Director Hatim Tyabji replaced Schulze as Best Buy chairman.In September 2012, Hubert Joly replaced Mikan as Best Buy CEO. Joly had previously served as CEO of Carlson, a hospitality conglomerate, since 2008. He led initiatives such as price matching, speeding up delivery times for online purchases, establishing \"store within a store\" sections for major brands such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Samsung, and giving more product training to employees.In April 2013, Best Buy exited the European consumer electronics market when it sold its 50% stake in The Carphone Warehouse back to the UK-based mobile phone retailer. The sale was worth around $775 million.An increasing trend towards online shopping began to erode revenues and profits in the 2010s. A 4% dip in sales for the June 30, 2014, quarter, marked the 10th quarter in a row where Best Buy\\'s sales had declined. The company, in announcing the result, said it was focusing more on digital media in its marketing, moving away from newspaper, magazine, and television advertising.On March 28, 2015, Best Buy announced the shutdown of the Future Shop chain in Canada; 65 of its 131 former locations were converted into Best Buy locations, while the rest (primarily those in close proximity to an existing Best Buy) were closed permanently.On March 1, 2018, the company announced that it would shut down its 250 standalone Best Buy Mobile stores in the United States by the end of May, due to low revenue and high costs. The Best Buy Mobile stores were reported to account for 1% of the company\\'s revenue.On May 9, 2018, the company unveiled a new logo for the first time in nearly three decades.On July 2, 2018, Best Buy announced it was cutting the amount of store space devoted to selling physical music, citing the popularity of streaming services as having reduced sales.On April 15, 2019, Best Buy announced that in June 2019, its current CFO, Corie Barry, would replace Hubert Joly who held the position of CEO since August 2012. Joly subsequently became executive chairman of the company.\\n\\n\\n=== 2020s ===\\nDespite an increase in sales of computer equipment due to an increase in remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, Best Buy laid off over 5,000 employees in early 2021 and forced many others into part-time positions.In August 2022, Best Buy said it would be laying off employees across the country after warnings of weaker sales, and the company cut its forecast for the remainder of 2022.On October 13, 2023, Best Buy announced that it would phase out the sale of physical home media in early 2024, citing changes in the market due to the prevalence of streaming video on demand services.\\n\\n\\n== Corporate affairs ==\\n\\n\\n=== Business operations ===\\n\\nBest Buy sells consumer electronics and a variety of related merchandise, including software, video games, music, mobile phones, digital cameras, car stereos, and video cameras, in addition to home appliances (washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators), in a noncommissioned sales environment. Under the Geek Squad brand, Best Buy offers computer repair, warranty service, and accidental service plans. Best Buy provides an online community forum for members, where consumers can discuss product experiences, ask questions, and get answers from other members or retail product experts.The building exteriors of Best Buy-branded stores are typically light brown, with the entrance designed to look like a blue box emerging from the structure. Corporate employees operated under a results only work environment from 2005 until March 2013, when the management style was abandoned by Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly.As of October 29, 2016, Best Buy operated 1,026 Best Buy, 331 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores, and 28 stand-alone Pacific Sales stores in the US. Best Buy also operated: 135 Best Buy and 53 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in Canada; and 18 Best Buy stores and 5 Best Buy Express stores in Mexico. Best Buy exited the European market in April 2013, selling its stake in the business back to its partner Carphone Warehouse.\\n\\n\\n=== House brands ===\\n\\nBest Buy also produces products under eight house brands:\\nDynex – Discount electronic and computer equipment such as Blu-ray players, data and power cables, HDTVs, office supplies, storage media, and webcams\\nInit – Storage products such as media storage, equipment bags, totes, and furniture for home theaters\\nInsignia – Electronic equipment, small appliances, and accessories including adapters, cables, HDTVs, mini refrigerators, and tablets\\nMagnolia Design Center (in select Best Buy stores) – design and installation of custom home theater setups\\nMagnolia Home Theater (in select Best Buy stores) – High-end home theater selections for both audio and visual equipment, including 4K, 3D, and large televisions, projectors, receivers, and speakers\\nModal – style-oriented mobile accessories, including Bluetooth speakers, cables, and cases\\nPacific Sales (in select Best Buy stores) – High-end appliances\\nPlatinum – Highest-quality in-house brand for the company, producing many products, such as cables, cell phone accessories, tablet accessories, and digital imaging equipment\\nRocketFish – Cables primarily used with home-theater installation and setup, as well as on computer and gaming accessories\\nRocketFish Mobile – Phone cases, gel skins, clips, and chargers for cell phones, GPS, and other exclusive high-end products\\n\\n\\n== Controversies ==\\n\\n\\n=== Warranty ===\\nIn 2000, two Florida consumers brought a lawsuit against the company, alleging that it engaged in fraudulent business practices related to the sale of extended warranties (or, more accurately, service plans). The suit claimed that store employees had misrepresented the manufacturer\\'s warranty to sell its own Product Service/Replacement Plan and that Best Buy had \"entered into a corporate-wide scheme to institute high-pressure sales techniques involving the extended warranties\" and that the company used \"artificial barriers to discourage consumers who purchased the \\'complete extended warranties\\' from making legitimate claims.\" The company ultimately settled for $200,000, but admitted no wrongdoing.In 2014, Best Buy settled for $4.55 million in a class-action lawsuit filed against them in April 2010 by consumers who claimed Best Buy was making unsolicited phone calls in contravention of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.\\n\\n\\n=== Pricing ===\\nIn the second quarter of 2007, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal ordered an investigation into the company\\'s use of an in-store website alleged to have misled customers on item sales prices. In December 2007, the Los Angeles Times reported on the same issue, in which some customers claimed they thought they were surfing the Internet version of bestbuy.com at an in-store kiosk only to learn that the site reflected in-store prices only. In response, company spokesperson Sue Busch indicated the in-store kiosks were not intended for price-match purposes and rather were a means to navigate in-store availability. Since the initial investigation, a banner was placed on the in-store site to make its customers more aware of the difference.\\n\\n\\n=== Analog televisions ===\\nOn April 26, 2008, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined the company $280,000 for not alerting customers that the analog televisions it sold would not receive over-the-air stations after the digital transition on June 12, 2009. The company challenged this ruling in May 2008 by the FCC saying it was and is in compliance with current FCC regulations pertaining to the digital transition.\\n\\n\\n=== Environmental issues ===\\nBest Buy was one of several companies named in a 2007 report by Greenpeace for purchasing raw materials or manufactured products derived thereof from logging companies that in the opinion of Greenpeace, contribute to unethical deforestation of taiga in Canada.Since that time, however, the company launched what it calls Greener Together to increase the energy efficiency of its products, and reduce consumer waste through more recyclable packaging and proper disposal of certain electronic components such as rechargeable batteries and empty ink cartridges.As a way to improve its image and past environmental issues, the company introduced a recycling program in 2009 that has since collected nearly half-a-billion pounds of consumer electronics and e-waste, and is available at all their stores for a nominal fee. These items are then handed over to certified recyclers in the U.S. for proper recycling. The company\\'s goal is to collect one billion pounds of recycling.It also has been named to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency top-50 list of the largest green-power purchasers. In 2011, the company purchased nearly 119 million kilowatt-hours of green power –  electricity generated from renewable resources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, biogas, biomass, and low-impact hydropower.\\n\\n\\n=== FBI collaboration ===\\nIn their attempt to combat child pornography, the FBI hired several Best Buy employees from the Geek Squad division to covertly work for them flagging potential targets. In one incident, a customer brought in his computer for troubleshooting, which a Best Buy employee flagged as containing images of child pornography and reported to the FBI. The customer was indicted for possession of child pornography, although the judge in the case later threw out nearly all the evidence against the defendant due to \"false and misleading statements\" made by an FBI agent while trying to secure a search warrant for the customer\\'s house, and the government ultimately dropped the case.\\n\\n\\n=== Privacy ===\\nOn October 20, 2023, CBC News released the results of a Marketplace investigation which found that that Best Buy technicians had viewed private files, such as intimate photos, on customer devices. One technician was also caught copying photos onto a USB flash drive.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nRetail apocalypse\\nList of retailers affected by the retail apocalypse\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\nVideos\\n\"Will Best Buy Survive Amazon?\".
