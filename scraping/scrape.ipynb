       "[{'name': 'Eastman Chemical Company',\n",
       "  'content': 'Eastman Chemical Company is an American company primarily involved in the chemical industry. Once a subsidiary of Kodak, today it is an independent global specialty materials company that produces a broad range of advanced materials, chemicals and fibers for everyday purposes. Founded in 1920 and based in Kingsport, Tennessee, the company operates 36 manufacturing sites worldwide and employs approximately 14,000 people.Eastman was spun off from parent Eastman Kodak in 1994. In 2021 it had sales revenue of approximately $10.5 billion.\\n\\n\\n== Business segments ==\\nEastman manufactures and markets chemicals, fibers, and plastics. It provides coatings, adhesives and specialty plastics products, is a major supplier of cellulose acetate fibers, and produces copolyesters for packaging.\\nThe company\\'s products and operations are managed and reported in four operating segments: Additives & Functional Products, Advanced Materials, Chemical Intermediates, and Fibers.\\nAdditives & Functional ProductsIn this segment, Eastman manufactures chemicals and adhesive resins for products in the coatings and tires industries in transportation, building and construction, durable goods, health and wellness, and consumables markets. The development of cyanoacrylates (\"super-glues\", or instant adhesives) is attributed to Harry Coover, an employee of Eastman. The adhesives were patented in 1956.\\nAdvanced MaterialsIn this segment, Eastman produces and markets specialty copolyesters, cellulose esters, interlayers, and aftermarket window film products for use in transportation, consumables, building and construction, durable goods, health and wellness, and electronics.\\n\\nChemical IntermediatesThe Chemical Intermediates segment leverages large scale and vertical integration from the acetyl, olefins, and alkylamine streams and proprietary manufacturing technology for specialty fluids to manufacture diversified products that are sold externally for use in markets such as industrial chemicals and processing; building and construction; health and wellness; energy, fuels, and water; consumables; agriculture, as well as used internally by other Eastman segments.\\n\\nFibersIn the Fibers segment, Eastman manufactures and sells Estron acetate tow and Estrobond triacetin plasticizers for use primarily in the manufacture of cigarette filters; Estron natural and Chromspun solution-dyed acetate yarns for use in apparel, home furnishings and industrial fabrics; and cellulose acetate flake and acetyl raw materials for other acetate fiber producers.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early years ===\\nAn effect of World War I was a scarcity in raw materials such as photographic paper, optical glass, gelatin and many chemicals, including methanol, acetic acid and acetone. After the war ended, George Eastman , founder of Eastman Kodak, began working to develop an independent supply of chemicals for his photographic processes. His search for suitable quantities of methanol and acetone led him to the southern United States.\\nIn 1920, George Eastman founded Tennessee Eastman with two major platforms: organic chemicals and acetyls.   Products such as calcium acetate, sodium acetate, acetic acid, and acetic anhydride became the basis for the company’s platforms.\\nDuring World War II, RDX, a powerful explosive, was manufactured for the U.S. government at Holston Ordnance Works at Tennessee Eastman sites. At the peak of production  near the end of the war, the ordnance plant was producing a million and a half pounds of explosives each day. Tennessee Eastman was responsible for managing the Y-12 National Security Complex at Oak Ridge, Tennessee which produced enriched uranium for the Manhattan Project, from 1943 to May 1947.\\nIn 1960, there was an explosion at Eastman\\'s Kingsport plant. It occurred in the Aniline production. Some 16 people were killed and many more were injured.\\n\\n\\n=== Since the 1980s ===\\nIn 1983, Eastman opened the first commercial coal gasification facility in the United States at its Kingsport plant site to produce chemicals from syngas rather than petroleum. The \"Chemicals from Coal Facility\" at the Kingsport plant was recognized in 1995 as a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society.In 1994, Eastman was spun off from Eastman Kodak and became an independent corporation. In early 2005, Eastman broke ground on the first world-scale manufacturing facility using IntegRex, a technology that reduces the number of intermediate process steps in producing PET resin. This technology is now owned by DAK Americas.\\nSince 2000, Eastman, and its many subsidiaries have paid more than $82 million in EPA fines. \\nIn July 2012, Eastman completed its acquisition of Solutia Inc., a manufacturer of performance materials and specialty chemicals, for $4.8 billion.In December 2014, Eastman Chemical Company completed its acquisition of Taminco Corporation for $2.8 billion.\\n\\n\\n=== October 2017 explosion ===\\nOn the morning of October 4, 2017, an explosion occurred at Eastman\\'s Kingsport Plant around the coal gasification building. In April 2018, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation determined the cause to be a valve blockage due to slurry or debris intrusion.\\n\\n\\n=== Circular economy ===\\nIn 2019, Eastman began commercial-scale chemical recycling for a broad set of waste plastics that would otherwise be placed in a landfill or incinerated. Eastman Advanced Circular Recycling technologies complement mechanical recycling by processing a wide spectrum of waste plastics that traditional recycling methods cannot, including polyesters, polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene. These waste plastics are derived from a variety of sources, including single-use plastics, textiles, and cuttings from discarded carpet. \\nEastman\\'s recycling technologies - carbon renewal technology and polyester renewal technology - provide a true circular solution of infinite recycling for materials, allowing them to be reused repeatedly. Eastman began commercial operation of carbon renewal technology in October 2019 at the company\\'s largest manufacturing facility in Kingsport, Tennessee. In 2020, Eastman will use carbon renewal technology to recycle millions of pounds of polyester carpet that would otherwise have been placed in a landfill.In January 2021, Eastman announced plans to build a methanolysis plant that will convert polyester waste into durable products. The company expects to spend approximately $250 million to build the facility. When completed by the end of 2022, the methanolysis plant will use over 100,000 metric tons of plastic waste that cannot be recycled by current mechanical methods to produce premium, high-quality specialty plastics made with recycled content.\\nIn January 2022, Eastman announced it would invest up to $1 billion in a material-to-material molecular recycling facility in France that would use Eastman\\'s polyester renewal technology to recycle up to 160,000 tons annually of plastic waste. The plant is expected to be operational by 2025.\\n\\n\\n== Mexican pine sourcing controversy ==\\nAn April 2017 article in The Daily Beast reported that Eastman Chemical\\'s plant in Uruapan, Michoacán bought pine rosin (refined, solidified resin) from a supplier that was known to be controlled by the Knights Templar criminal cartel, even after being notified of the supplier\\'s criminal links. The supplier (Unored) was using the cartel to extort the raw pine resin gatherers to accept sub-market prices, with a portion of the reduction passed on to Eastman in lower prices.\\n\\n\\n== Manufacturing sites ==\\nAs of December 2023, Eastman Chemical Company operates 36 manufacturing sites in 12 countries:\\n\\n\\n== Corporate responsibility ==\\nEastman has been a member of Responsible Care, a voluntary initiative developed autonomously by the chemical industry to improve health, safety, and environmental performance, for more than 25 years. In 2013, Eastman was named Responsible Care Company of the Year in the large company category by the American Chemistry Council (ACC). Eastman was awarded the 2009 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award presented by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The award recognizes technologies that incorporate the principles of green chemistry into chemical design, manufacture, and use.\\nIn 2013, the EPA designated a 3-km radius circle around the Eastman facility in Kingsport, TN as non-attainment for the 2010 1-hour sulfur dioxide (SO2) primary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The State of Tennessee continues to monitor ambient sulfur dioxide levels within the non-attainment area.\\nThrough 2015, Eastman improved energy intensity by approximately 8% compared to a 2008 baseline. The company established a goal to improve energy intensity 20% by 2020. In 2014 and early 2016, Eastman converted two boilers at its Kingsport, Tennessee, site from coal to natural gas combustion. Three additional boilers will be converted by 2018 for a total of five. The Kingsport boiler conversion project is the most significant air pollution control project in the history of Eastman and will diversify the Kingsport facility’s energy mix from 90% coal to 50% coal and 50% natural gas. Eastman also converted a coal-fired boiler at its Indian Orchard facility in Springfield, Massachusetts, to natural gas in 2015.As of 2019, Eastman has been recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year eight consecutive years. Eastman has also been recognized three consecutive years by Glassdoor as an Employees’ Choice Best Place to Work and by Ethisphere Institute as a World’s Most Ethical Company.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website \\nEnvironmental Release Report\\nCompany Annual Report\\nTennessee Eastman Company/Eastman Chemical Company in The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture\\nBusiness data for Eastman Chemical Company:',\n",

The company\\'s chair of the board have been Charles Knight (1974–2004), and David Farr (2004–2021). Jim Turley is the current Chair of the Board.\\nEmerson is structured into two business units: automation; and commercial and residential.\\n\\n\\n== Environmental records ==\\nIn 2008 (using data from 2005), researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Emerson as the 97th largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, down from its previous rank of 56th. Major pollutants indicated by the study include nickel compounds, manganese, diisocyanate, and lead.\\n\\n\\n== Corporate relationships ==\\n\\n\\n=== Emerson\\'s brands acquisitions ===\\nOn December 22, 2014, Emerson announced the acquisition of Scotland-based Cascade Technologies Ltd., expanding their gas-analysis portfolio with laser-based measurement analyzers and systems for enhanced industrial emissions monitoring, production efficiencies, and regulatory compliance. Other main Emerson acquisitions and brands include:\\n\\n\\n=== NBC Heroes lawsuit ===\\nOn October 2, 2006, Emerson filed suit in federal court against NBC regarding a scene that appeared in the pilot episode of the network\\'s TV series Heroes. The scene depicted Claire Bennet reaching into an active garbage disposal, severely injuring her hand. Emerson\\'s suit claims the scene \"casts the disposer in an unsavory light, irreparably tarnishing the product\" by suggesting that serious injuries will result \"in the event consumers were to accidentally insert their hand into one.\"\\nEmerson asked for a ruling barring future broadcasts of the pilot and to block NBC from using any Emerson trademarks in the future.\\nOn February 23, 2007, the case was dropped. NBC Universal and Emerson Electric settled the lawsuit outside of court.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website\\nBusiness data for Emerson Electric Co.:',\n",

(23%)\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Within Philips ===\\nIn 1953 Philips started a small scale production facility in the center of the Dutch city Nijmegen as part of its main industry group \"Icoma\" (Industrial Components and Materials), followed by the opening of a new factory in 1955. In 1965 Icoma became part of a new Philips main industry group: \"Elcoma\" (Electronic Components and Materials). In 1975 Silicon Valley–based Signetics was acquired by Philips. Signetics claimed to be the \"first company in the world established expressly to make and sell integrated circuits\" and inventor of the 555 timer IC. At the time, it was claimed that with the Signetics acquisition, Philips was now number two in the league table of semiconductor manufacturers in the world. In 1987, Philips was ranked Europe\\'s largest semiconductor maker. The year after, all Philips semiconductor subsidiaries, including Signetics, Faselec (in Switzerland) and Mullard (in the UK), were merged in the newly formed product division Components. The semiconductor activities were split off from Components in 1991 under the name Philips Semiconductors. In June 1999, Philips acquired VLSI Technology, at the time making Philips the world\\'s sixth largest semiconductor company.\\n\\n\\n=== Independent company ===\\nIn December 2005, Philips announced its intention to divest Philips Semiconductors into an independent legal entity. In September 2006, Philips completed the sale of an 80.1% stake in Philips Semiconductors to a consortium of private equity investors consisting of KKR, Bain Capital, Silver Lake Partners, Apax Partners and AlpInvest Partners. The new company name NXP (from Next eXPerience) was announced on August 31, 2006, and the company was officially launched during the Internationale Funkausstellung (IFA) consumer electronics show in Berlin. The newly independent NXP was ranked as one of the world\\'s top 10 semiconductor companies.In February 2007, when NXP announced that it would acquire Silicon Laboratories’ AeroFONE single-chip phone and power amplifier product lines to strengthen its Mobile and Personal business. The next year, NXP announced that it would transform its Mobile and Personal business unit into a joint venture with STMicroelectronics, which in 2009 became ST-Ericsson, a 50/50 joint venture of Ericsson Mobile Platforms and STMicroelectronics, after ST purchased NXP\\'s 20% stake. In April 2008, NXP announced it would acquire the set-top box business of Conexant to complement its existing Home business unit. In September 2008, NXP announced that it would restructure its manufacturing, R&D and back office operations, resulting in 4,500 job cuts worldwide. In October 2009, NXP announced that it would sell its Home business unit to Trident Microsystems.Before the divestiture of Nexperia in June 2016, NXP was a volume supplier of discrete and standard logic devices, celebrating its 50 years in logic (via its history as both Signetics and Philips Semiconductors) in March 2012.NXP\\'s first CEO was Frans van Houten; he was succeeded by Richard L. Clemmer on January 1, 2009. Since May 2020, Kurt Sievers serves as president and CEO.\\n\\n\\n=== Freescale acquisition ===\\nIn March 2015, a merger agreement was announced through which NXP would merge with competitor Freescale Semiconductor. In view of this merger, NXP\\'s RF Power activities were sold to JAC Capital for US$1.8 billion and rebranded as Ampleon, in a transaction closed in November 2015. Both NXP and Freescale had deep roots stretching back to when they were part of Philips (NXP), and Motorola (Freescale) respectively. Both had similar revenue; US$4.8 billion and US$4.2 billion in 2013 for NXP and Freescale, respectively with NXP primarily focusing on near field communication (NFC) and high-performance mixed signal (HPMS) hardware, and Freescale focusing on its microprocessor and microcontroller businesses, and both companies possessing roughly equal patent portfolios. On December 7, 2015, NXP completed the merger with Freescale Semiconductor; the merged company continued its operation as NXP Semiconductors N.V.\\n\\n\\n=== Notable events ===\\nOn July 26, 2010, NXP announced that it had acquired Jennic, based in Sheffield, UK, which now operates as part of its smart home and energy product line, using Zigbee and JenNet-IP.\\nOn August 6, 2010, NXP announced its initial public offering at Nasdaq, with 34 million shares, pricing each $14.\\nIn December 2010, NXP announced that it would sell its Sound Solutions business to Knowles Electronics, part of Dover Corporation, for $855 million in cash. The acquisition was completed as of July 5, 2011.\\nIn April 2012, NXP announced its intent to acquire electronic design consultancy Catena to work on automotive applications.\\nIn July 2012, NXP sold its high-speed data converter assets to Integrated Device Technology.\\nIn 2012, revenue for NXP\\'s Identification business unit was $986 million, up 41% from 2011, in part due to growing sales of NFC chips and secure elements.\\nOn January 4, 2013, NXP and Cisco announced their investment in Cohda Wireless, an Australian company focused on car-to-car and car-to-infrastructure communications.\\nIn January 2013, NXP announced 700-900 redundancies worldwide in an effort to cut costs related to \"support services\".\\nIn May 2013, NXP announced that it acquired Code Red Technologies, a provider of embedded software development such as the LPCXpresso IDE and Red Suite.\\nIn July 2014, NXP was reported to have terminated the employment of union organizers.  A campaign was started for their reinstatement.\\nIn August 2015, a joint-venture with the Beijing JianGuang Asset Management Co. Ltd. was registered in Shanghai, China under the name WeEn Semiconductors.\\nOn June 14, 2016, it was announced that Nexperia would be divested from NXP to a consortium of financial investors consisting of Beijing Jianguang Asset Management Co., Ltd (“JAC Capital”) and Wise Road Capital LTD (“Wise Road Capital”). WeEn Semiconductors started delivery of bipolar and SiC power semiconductors, TRIACs, IGBT modules, etc.\\nIn April 2017, Qualcomm received approval from U.S. antitrust regulators for the acquisition of NXP for $47 billion. However, the acquisition has not received approval from Chinese authorities and Qualcomm has refiled an antitrust application and request to purchase with the PRC Ministry of Commerce.\\nIn September 2018, NXP announced that it acquired OmniPHY, a provider of automotive Ethernet subsystem technology.\\nOn December 6, 2019, NXP announced the completion of the acquisition of the wireless connectivity assets from Marvell.\\nOn May 27, 2020, NXP announced that at its Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (“AGM”) that shareholders overwhelmingly approved the appointment of Kurt Sievers as an executive director and the company\\'s chief executive officer effective immediately thereby replacing Richard Clemmer, who previously led the company for 11 years. In this capacity Mr. Sievers will also remain President of NXP, a role he has held since 2018.\\nOn June 18, 2020, NXP announced HoverGames Challenge 2: Help Drones Help Others.\\nOn July 21, 2020, NXP delivered secure and scalable edge-connected platforms based on its i.MX RT crossover processors and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth solutions.\\nOn August 11, 2020, NXP\\'s industry-first solution to combine UWB fine-ranging, NFC, Secure Element, and embedded SIM (eSIM) was included in Samsung\\'s new Galaxy Note20 Ultra.\\n\\n\\n== Controversies ==\\nIn March 2013, NXP locked out workers at its plant in Bangkok, Thailand. The reason was stalled negotiations over a new work schedule with their trade union, which was affiliated with the Confederation of Thai Electrical Appliances, Electronic Automobile & Metalworkers (TEAM). Management then called in small groups of workers, asked them if they agreed with the union\\'s demands, and told them to leave if they did. They were not able to enter the factory the next day. In response, TEAM staged protests outside the factory and on March 13 outside the Dutch embassy and also filed a complaint with the National Human Right Commission. On April 29, mediation by the Ministry of Labour led to the signing of a memorandum that passed the decision over the work schedule to the Labour Relations Committee. The committee decided on June 20 that the new work schedule did not violate Thai labour law; however, the National Human Rights Committee decided otherwise and recommended the factory should revert to the old schedule. NXP continues to demand regular 12-hour shifts.In May 2014, the company fired 24 workers at its plant in the special economic zone  in Cabuyao, The Philippines. The workers were all officials of a trade union affiliated with the Metal Workers Alliance of the Philippines (MWAP). Reports said they were fired due to their union functions in negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement. Factory owners claimed the workers were fired after refusing to work on April 9, while workers said they had not been paid for two months. IndustriALL and its affiliated unions in the Philippines condemned the dismissals. In September, MWAP and NXP reached an agreement by which 12 of the fired workers were reinstated and the other 12 received separation packages. NXP also committed itself to a long-term wage increase. In the summer of 2015, a member of the Dutch parliament questioned trade minister Lilianne Ploumen regarding NXP\\'s behaviour.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nNXP MIFARE contactless smart cards and proximity cards\\nNXP LPC microcontrollers\\nNXP QorIQ microprocessors\\nNXP GreenChip\\nLansheng Technology\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website \\nBusiness data for NXP Semiconductors:',\n",
